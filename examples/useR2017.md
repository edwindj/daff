In data analysis, it can be necessary to compare two files comparing tabular data.  Unfortunately, existing tools have been  customized for comparing source code or other text files, and are unsuitable for comparing tabular data.    

The *daff* R package provides tools for comparing and tracking changes in tabular data stored in data.frames.  *daff* wraps Paul Fitz's multi-language *daff* package (https://github.com/paulfitz/daff), which generates data diff that capture row and column modifications, reorders, additions, and deletions.   These data diffs follow a standard format (https://paulfitz.github.io/daff-doc/spec.html) which can be used to HTML formatted diffs, summarize changes, and even _patch_ (a new version of) input data.

*daff* augments brings the utility of source-code change tracking tools to tabular data, enabling data versioning as a component of software development and reproducible research.
