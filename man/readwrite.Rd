\description{
The diff information is stored in the Coopy highlighter diff format:
\url{http://dataprotocols.org/tabular-diff-format/}
}
\details{
Note that type information of the target data.frame is lost when writing a patch to disk.
Using a stored diff to patch a \code{data.frame} will use the column types of the source
\code{data.frame} to determine the target column types. New introduced columns may become \code{characters}.

Names of the reference and comparison dataset are also lost when writing a data_diff object
to disk.
