Description: Diff, patch and merge for data frames. Document changes in data sets and use them to apply patches.
    Changes to data can be made visible by using render_diff. Daff uses the V8 package to
    wrap the 'daff.js' javascript library which is included in the package.
    Daff exposes a subset of 'daff.js' functionality, tailored for usage within R.
